##Week 1: setting up git and github

What is this “README” thing? What is a .md file? Is a readme file created for every repository? 
Why do I have both README.md and README.html files?
What is the git “editor”?
What is the difference between a project and a repository?
What is the point of having an html file and an .rmd file?
How can you view an html file once it’s in github, as if it was a webpage?

Notes:
+ You can edit a file in R, in your computer’s terminal, or in the browser on GitHub and integrate the changes across all platforms.
+ .Rmd files are RMarkdown files.

Why build phylogenies? Video

phylogenies can be used for:
    +	estimating extinction/speciation/diversification
    +	formulating hypotheses (example of gene being predicted and induced)
    +	testing hypotheses (example of asking which traits are important for diversification in certain groups)
    +	 determining whether or not there are correlations between traits (leaf size and longevity in conifers and angiosperms—correlation is not there when accounting for phylogeny)
